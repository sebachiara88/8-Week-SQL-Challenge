# Description

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.
