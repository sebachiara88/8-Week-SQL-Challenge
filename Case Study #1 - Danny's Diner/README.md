# Description

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions

- What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
- How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
- What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
- What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
- Which item was the most popular for each customer?
- Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
- Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
- What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
- If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
- In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
